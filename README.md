#Summernote Plugins
A few plugins I have developed for the [Summernote](https://github.com/summernote/summernote/) WYSIWYG editor

##summernote-emoji
A plugin to add a dropdown menu for adding emoji images with just a few clicks.  All images are embedded in the JS file as base64 strings, so output is entirely portable.  The CSS file is only for adding a few nice tweaks, not essentially necessary.

I have only added my favorite emojis, though using my conversion tool at http://justineldracher.github.io/image-converter.html you can easily add your own.

##summernote-ext-specialchars
Just a few tweaks I made to the official SpecialChars plugin to suit my own taste.
